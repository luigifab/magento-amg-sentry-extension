# sentry

This is a fork. I think it works. DSN JS not yet implemented.

**This new version is fully incompatible with previous ones.**

Run the following queries to update and delete old configuration values:
```sql
UPDATE core_config_data SET path = REPLACE(path, "/amg-sentry/", "/sentry/") WHERE path LIKE "%/amg-sentry/%";
UPDATE core_config_data SET path = REPLACE(path, "-", "_") WHERE path LIKE "%/sentry/%";
UPDATE core_config_data SET path = "dev/sentry/dsn_js_front" WHERE path LIKE "dev/sentry/dsn_js";
DELETE FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE "dev/sentry/php_errors";
DELETE FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE "dev/sentry/php_exceptions";
DELETE FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE "dev/sentry/ignore_error_control_operator";
DELETE FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE "dev/sentry/%" AND path NOT LIKE "dev/sentry/logger"
  AND path NOT LIKE "dev/sentry/dsn_js_front" AND scope_id != 0;
```

To install:
- run `composer require luigifab/openmage-sentry`
- apply `openmage.diff` or `openmage-more.diff`
- apply `errors.diff`

For configuration, go to: `System / Configuration / Developer / Sentry`.
