Run the following queries to update and delete old configuration values (to v2+):
```sql
UPDATE core_config_data SET path = REPLACE(path, "/amg-sentry/", "/sentry/") WHERE path LIKE "%/amg-sentry/%";
UPDATE core_config_data SET path = REPLACE(path, "-", "_") WHERE path LIKE "%/sentry/%";
UPDATE core_config_data SET path = "dev/sentry/dsn_js_front" WHERE path LIKE "dev/sentry/dsn_js";
DELETE FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE "dev/sentry/php_errors";
DELETE FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE "dev/sentry/php_exceptions";
DELETE FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE "dev/sentry/ignore_error_control_operator";
DELETE FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE "dev/sentry/%" AND path NOT LIKE "dev/sentry/logger"
  AND path NOT LIKE "dev/sentry/dsn_js_front" AND scope_id != 0;
```

To install:
- run `composer require luigifab/openmage-sentry`
- apply `openmage.diff` or `openmage-more.diff`
- apply `errors.diff`

To upgrade:
- revert `openmage.diff` or `openmage-more.diff`
- upgrade with composer
- apply `openmage.diff` or `openmage-more.diff`

After any upgrade of OpenMage, apply `errors.diff` and `openmage[-more].diff` again.

For configuration, go to: `System / Configuration / Developer / Sentry`.

Notes:
- errors when profiling with Blackfire are not sent to Sentry
- errors are sent to Sentry after `fastcgi_finish_request` in the `__destruct()`
- run _varnish-sentry.php_ in a `screen`
